# Keep Beats 1 from Apple Music Playing

I'm running a [Nicecast](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/nicecast/) server to broadcast music from iTunes so that I can listen to Beats 1 radio on SONOS speakers.

This AppleScript checks iTunes every 10 seconds and plays Beats 1 if nothing is currently playing. This is useful because iTunes will occasionally pause the radio station.
